# My Profile!
Welcome to my profile, here you will learn a bit about who I am, why I'm interested in IT, what type of job I would like, see a few test results, and my chosen project idea.
## Personal Information
The internet can be a place that harms a user more than it can benefit them.

My Name is Abdul-Kadir Coskun,
I was given the student number S3558983,
A student email S3558983@student.rmit.edu.au,
A little bit about me is that I speak two languages English and Turkish at home, that I work in the security industry, and develop games in my free time(currently working on a roguelike called Elich). I love experimenting with C# and the Unity Engine!
