## Interest in IT -
My interest in IT is to develop an application that will provide a smile to the user's face, my interest in IT started when my father introduced me to a game called Diablo 2 when I was age 5, ever since I was hooked on using IT to just about do everything but mainly using it for its automated capabilities. I learned how to make use of macros, program applications, and automate calculations.
