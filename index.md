# My Profile!
Welcome to my profile, here you will learn a bit about who I am, why I'm interested in IT, what type of job I would like, see a few test results, and my chosen project idea.

## Personal Information
> The internet can be a place that harms a user more than it can benefit them.

My name is Abdul-Kadir Coskun,  
I was obtained the student number S3558983,  
A student email S3558983@student.rmit.edu.au,  
A bit about me is that I speak two languages English and Turkish, that I work in the security industry, and develop games in my free time(currently working on a roguelike called Elich).  
I love experimenting with C# and Unity Engine!

## Interest in IT
My interest in IT is to develop an application that will provide a smile to the user's face as my interest in IT started when my father introduced me to a game called Diablo 2 when I was age 5, ever since I was hooked on using IT to do just about everything but mainly using it for its automated capabilities. I learned how to make use of macros, program applications, and automate calculations.  

I chose RMIT mainly for the brand as it's a globally recognized university that's renowned for its leadership and innovation in technology, design, and enterprise. I found that students that have attended RMIT speak nothing but praises for it.  

I expect to learn a plethora of additional skills such as new code languages, better essay writing, and gain information that will help build my foundational knowledge in IT. I have spent quite a bit of time using IT and, in that time, I believe that I have neglected many aspects of IT that will be of great benefit to me. 

## Ideal Job

This position is looking for someone that is both senior and experienced in software development, they must be skilled in many different coding languages and need to be able to develop, contribute and collaborate well. This position appeals to me as I strive to challenge myself constantly, it would allow me to use technology that I seldom ever touch.  

This position requires the applicant to have the following skills, qualifications, and experience:
* 5+ years of software development experience
* General knowledge of Vue/React/Javascript
* General knowledge of Django/Python
* General knowledge of Restful API & Websockets
* General knowledge of Unity/C#  

I currently possess these requirements, 4+ years of software development experience, and General knowledge of Javascript, Python, Unity, and C#.  

The plan is to continue to develop games/applications to build up more experience, take short courses for the code languages, Django/Vue/React and learn how to use Restful API and Websockets, taking short courses and asking fellow developers for advice.

## Personal Profile (Test Results)
**16personalities:**  
<img src="/Images/16personalities.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" style="max-width: 75;">  
**personalitymax:**

**mindtools(creativity test):**  
<img src="/Images/MindTools.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" style="max-width: 75;">  

These results tell me that I can be imaginative and open-minded to many things that I find as I tend to enjoy a sense of adventure and don't mind experiencing setbacks. But I found that they could also mean that I can be unfocused at times as my imagination can be one step ahead of my progress, causing me to be disorganized.  

I don't know how well these results might affect my behaviour within a team, as I believe that as long as I keep a key focus on a goal set out by the team and work towards it. I will be able to overcome the self-conscience emotions that may develop as a result of these results.  

I will take into consideration the most positive aspects of these results and try to limit the negative ones, only this way I believe, I can put my all when forming a team with others.

## Project Idea
My project idea is to create a game that talks to the player on an emotional level. It will strive to tug at the heartstrings of the player as it will be story-driven, featuring a protagonist that talks about their lost love, how the passage of time brings the two of them closely and how life can be both cruel but forgiving.   
This project idea can be of great benefit as many people are suffering from mental health problems such as anxiety or depression with little or no outlet. This game will strive to be such an outlet through relation, hoping to induce crying as studies have shown that “crying is a natural response to a range of emotions, from deep sadness and grief to extreme happiness and joy.” (Newhouse, 2021) The benefits of crying allow the player to release oxytocin and endogenous opioids, also known as endorphins which are feel-good chemicals produced by the human body to relieve stress and pain.  
The game will be a 2D side scroller that focuses on providing a stunning parallax background with soft and slow narration to pace the player to create a sad and suspenseful atmosphere.  
The choice of using a parallax background is to allow the player to see that the protagonist is constantly moving forward as they follow the narration of the protagonist’s memories before slowly coming to a halt at its end. The soft and slow narration allows for pacing within the game’s story and allows for small visual events to proceed based on verbal triggers, this allows for the player to develop a relationship between what they hear and what they see which in turn creates better immersion within the game.  
There will be a strong focus on a hands-off approach causing the game to be rather like watching a movie allowing the player to focus on just immersing themselves within the story.  
The design of this game will focus on simplicity, allowing for only a menu scene to lay the foundation of getting a player prepared with a small selection of buttons within the UI (User Interface). Its background will be of a mountainous terrain within which lies a lake, slow muffled piano music that emulates sorrow will be played throughout along with the muffled sound of light rain. Upon pressing the play button, the scene will fade slowly into the game scene, causing the slow piano music and light rain to no longer be muffled. The protagonist of the story will come into view walking forward, upon the completion of the narration, the protagonist and parallax background will come to a stop with their lost love’s tombstone coming into view. The game scene will then fade slowly to black, ending the sound of the music and light rain sounds, displaying credits and a different soundtrack symbolising the end of the game.  
The tools and technologies required for such an undertaking would require a computer with the latest operating system such as Windows 10 to deal with compatibility issues. Furthermore, as there is a key focus in reaching a large audience, the Unity Engine will be used to assist with this as it is developed to produce games that can be played across a large range of devices. Visual Studio Code will be the IDE (Integrated development environment) of choice because of its compatibility and diverse extensions that would allow faster commits to Github for version control, which will provide safe backups.  
The skills required to bring this project idea to life would be the following:  
•	General knowledge of C#  
•	General knowledge of the Unity Engine  
•	The ability to Google efficiently  
•	Creative design  
These skills are required as it is a requirement to use C# when using Unity Engine classes such as MonoBehaviour. Being able to google efficiently allows for faster troubleshooting or generally finding a better implementation of code. Creative design is also a requirement as we are attempting to build connections via good visuals and sound.  
If this project idea provides the intended effects to induce crying, I believe that it would a valid contribution in providing a somewhat effective means of combating depression and anxiety. But at the same time, it wouldn’t be a considered solution to the main problem but more of an outlet, effectively allowing one to destress. As long as one person gains some benefit from this project, I would consider it rather successful for it served its intended purpose.
