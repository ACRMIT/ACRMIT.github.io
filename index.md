## Personal Information -
> The internet can be a place that harms a user more than it can benefit them.

My Name is Abdul-Kadir Coskun,  
I was given the student number S3558983,  
A student email S3558983@student.rmit.edu.au,  
A little bit about me is that I speak two languages English and Turkish at home, that I work in the security industry, and develop games in my free time(currently working on a roguelike called Elich).  
I love experimenting with C# and Unity Engine!

## Interest in IT -
My interest in IT is to develop an application that will provide a smile to the user's face, my interest in IT started when my father introduced me to a game called Diablo 2 when I was age 5, ever since I was hooked on using IT to just about do everything but mainly using it for its automated capabilities. I learned how to make use of macros, program applications, and automate calculations.  

I chose RMIT mainly for the brand as it's a globally recognized university that's renowned for its leadership and innovation in technology, design, and enterprise. I found that students that have attended RMIT speak nothing but praises for it.  

I expect to learn a plethora of additional skills such as new code languages, better essay writing, and gain information that will help build my foundational knowledge in IT. I have spent quite a bit of time using IT and, in that time, I believe that I have neglected many aspects of IT that will be of great benefit to me.

This position requires the applicant to have the following skills, qualifications, and experience:
* 5+ years of software development experience
